# WordPress 101

{{% note %}} 
This presentation is meant to give you a brief overview of WordPress and some basics of how to use it. Each of the topics could be its very own presentation, so if you have more questions, let me know at the end and we can go more in depth on something or plan an entire presentation on it in the future.
