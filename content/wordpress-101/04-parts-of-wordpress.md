The database is the powerhouse of your website. It stores all the content of your site, all the posts, comments, images, etc. It also stores all the changes that are made, all the settings you choose. Everything is put into the database.

If you aren't familiar with databases, you can think of one as a bunch of fancy excel sheets that all connect to each other.

# 4. WordPress Plugins

{{% note %}}
Plugins add extra functionality to your site, making it do everything from e-commerce to photo slideshows. WordPress.org has a plugin directory as well. Tips for choosing good plugins include: look for a lot of positive reviews, downloads and ratings. A plugin with a 5 star rating and 100 downloads may not be as good as one with a 4-star rating and 100k downloads. Look at how recently a plugin was updated and if it's compatible with the current version of WordPress. You can also click on the "Support" link and see what kind of problems users are reporting.
