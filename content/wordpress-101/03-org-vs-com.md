> **WordPress.com** is a service that helps you build a website using the WordPress software with managed hosting, while **WordPress.org** is the source where you can download the software itself, which you can use to build and maintain a website on your own.

Kinda like renting vs owning. When you rent, your landlord takes care of a bunch of stuff stuff for you and there are restrictions on what you can and can't change. When you own, you have to do a bunch more yourself, like lawn maintenance, or pay a third party to do it for you. WordPress.com takes care of your domain, hosting, security and maintenance for you. What kind of restrictions are placed on your site depends on the plan you have with WordPress.com.

WordPress.org gives you a lot more control and flexibility, however, you are responsible for more as well.
