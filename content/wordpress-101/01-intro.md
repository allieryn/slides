I'm going to be throwing a lot of information and terms at you today. If you're new to WordPress, please don't get discouraged. When I first found WordPress, I was making my first blog. I wanted to change the default color of the background and went down a rabbit hole. It's been 9 years, a degree and a freelance career, and I'm still going down it.
