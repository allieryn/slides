# What is WordPress

---

Content Management System
(CMS)

{{% note %}}
CMS: were created to allow users to create websites without any kind of programming.
The user interface for editing web pages looks similar to a word processor and is able to add and position images.
Other requirements not like a word processor:
- creation of new web pages and adding them to a navigation system
- more than one person can edit it at a time without destroying each other's work
- each person has a way to sign in and manage their account
- people have different levels of permission to make changes, called roles
